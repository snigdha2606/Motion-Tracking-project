# Motion-Tracking-project
Motion Tracking for Medical Imaging.
The acquisition of medical pictures (such as MRI, PET, etc.) frequently demands the patient's immobility for extended periods of time. This demand cannot be met, not even by the most obedient patients. Methods of motion compensation are employed to address this issue. The motion of the patients is tracked, and this data is incorporated into an algorithm for image reconstruction to account for this involuntary movement. This project involves techniques for monitoring patients' 3D movements.
